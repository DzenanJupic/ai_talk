It contains thousands of images of handwritten digits and is heavily used by machine learning beginners for building their first CNN.\n","\n","## Your task\n","Create a neural network that can classify handwritten digits with an accuracy of over <b>98%</b>.\n","\n","There is no need for writing code! All the code is prewritten, but in its current state, it would perform relatively poorly.  \n","Your job is to tweak the parameters until the CNN reaches the desired accuracy!\n","\n","### NOTE\n","The cells should be executed one after the other. If you skip a cell, this can lead to errors down the line. Executing a cell multiple times is not a problem. If you go back to a previous cell, you also have to execute all the following cells.\n","\n","After executing a cell with an `#auto` attribute manually once, it will execute automatically whenever you change a parameter.\n","\n","Furthermore, be careful: Sometimes, certain combinations of parameters lead to errors!\n","\n","## Visualization\n","Throughout the challenge, you can find code cells called 'VISUALIZE _'. If you execute these cells, you can see what is happening under the hood.  \n","Skipping them will not lead to errors.\n","\n","## Testing\n","At the end of the notebook, you will find a testing environment that allows passing handwritten digits to the CNN. When trained properly, it should be able to tell which number you wrote down.\n","\n","If you like, you can train the CNN in its current state to see how badly it performs. This will make the learning process even more impressive.\n","\n","## Tips\n","The next few cells are tips. You can use them one after the other when you are stuck. Skipping them will not lead to errors."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wEnMZyMwY3UP","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@title Tip 1\n","print(\n","\"Increasing parameters to their max won't always increase performance. \\\n","In many cases, big parameters even smaller the performance. \\\n","So bigger is not always better!\"\n",")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qIsrFDGGZNEh","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@title Tip 2\n","print(\n","\"For the output layer, you need the softmax activation. \\\n","This activation function converts all the values into probabilities.\"\n",")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7Dt7bU7SaXOl","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@title Tip 3\n","print(\n","\"For all other layers, relu is a great idea. \\\n","This function will return 0 for all negative x, and x for all positive x.\"\n",")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"htss2T0xZh_M","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@title Tip 4\n","print(\"For multi-class classification, categorical_cross_entropy is a fantastic loss function.\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ch-v65rFdbwe","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@title Tip 5\n","print(\"A big batch size often ruins your result.
