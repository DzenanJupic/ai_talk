 ## AI Types
 The are two major types of AIs:
 
 #### Strong AI
 We don't have strong AIs yet. A strong AI would be able to reason about things with human level or even
 over human level intelligence. Also, such an AI could handle complex unexpected challenges without any
 problem.
 
 #### Weak AI
 Just because it's called 'Weak AI' doesn't mean they perform poorly. These AIs are already often better
 in doing certain things then we are. Examples are playing games like chess, constructing safe buildings or
 super strong light weight materials. The attribute weak just describes the disability of the AI to generalize
 its knowledge.
 
 ## AI Architectures
 
 #### NNs
 A simple neural network is the easiest possible architecture for machine learning. Such a NN contains 1D
 layers that take a 1D input and calculates a 1D output.
 
 ### RNNs
 A Recurrent Neural Networks are networks, that not only take normal input but also take input from them
 self.
 
 ### CNNs
 Convolutional Neural Network are the best choice for classifying images. They are modeled after our
 brains and accomplish stunning results.
 
 ### Others
 There are many, many more architectures. If you would like to read more, look [here](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/main-types-of-neural-networks-and-its-applications-tutorial-734480d7ec8e)
